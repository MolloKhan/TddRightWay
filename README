# TDD The Right Way

### Project Installation
After downloading the project, run:
- composer install
- Set up your database credentials in the `.env.test.local` file
- symfony doctrine:database:create -e test
- symfony doctrine:schema:create -e test
- symfony run bin/phpunit (you should see "No tests executed!")

### Workshop Requirements
- PHP 8.2 or greater
- Environment ready to run a traditional Symfony app
- Any database compatible with Doctrine

### Nice to have:
- Ability to run tests through your IDE
